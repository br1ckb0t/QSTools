QSTools
=======

A suite of tools for programmatically interacting efficiently with the QuickSchools API and GUI.


Rules:
* If a script has a docstring at the top, it will not be deleted. Instead, it will be maintained to continue to match that docstring, even if the implementation completely changes.
   * Furthermore, in these "public" scripts, the implementation will be kept up to date to ensure that they can be used quickly and reliably under a deadline.
